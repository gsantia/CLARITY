# CLARITY

A work in progress. Will a use custom machine learning algorithm from a previous
project which determined whether a Facebook user was a bot or not in a slightly
altered fashion in order to determine whether a single comment was created by a bot
or not. Will be streaming, and classify comments as they are made on notable Facebook
threads, in real time.
